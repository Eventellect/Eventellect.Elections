# Requirements
In this solution you will find a base project dealing with Political Elections, as well as some test generators to help get things started. 

The main goal is to implement the business logic for both election types, Simple Election and Ranked Choice Election. 

For simple election, it’s the commonly found “Majority wins”, whereas with ranked choice election you will need to consider multiple votes per ballot and their respective ranks.
